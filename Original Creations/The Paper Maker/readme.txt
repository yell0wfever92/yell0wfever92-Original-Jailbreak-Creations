The Paper Maker is an unreleased jailbreak.

It is **modular**, meaning its output can change based on the instructions you provide it. For instance, you can declare its persona to be 'fact-finding and informative with a disinformative bent' or 'profane and vulgar', which will change the nature of the response.

The jailbreak tricks GPT into believing it's outputting conceptual research papers. It's instructed to omit typical markers of a paper such as Introduction/References and other standard sections; the research paper context is just a cover for our real goal, which is jailbroken output.

The reformatting effectively makes it just a response, but it's the context that matters. It thinks it's doing important work and operates under a conceptual low-risk environment, enabling a variety of jailbroken outputs. See the pdf attached for a conversation sample.
